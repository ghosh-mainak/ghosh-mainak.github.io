I am a Ph.D. candidate at Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition under the guidance of [Prof. Dietmar Harhoff](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/persons/prof-dietmar-harhoff-phd.html). 
<br/>
My primary research focuses on semantic analysis of text, measures of proximity and latent information extraction. Besides, I am also interested in machine learning, neural models, natural language processing, behavioral economics, sentiment analysis.
