I am a Ph.D. candidate at Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition under the guidance of [Prof. Dietmar Harhoff](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/persons/prof-dietmar-harhoff-phd.html). 
<br/>
My primary research focuses on machine learning-based semantic similarity of textual data, latent information extraction. In addition to that, social media analysis, behavioral economics, and sentiment analysis are also part of my interests.
