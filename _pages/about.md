I am a master's student in Data Engineering and Analytics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. Prior to that, I was employed as a software engineer for 3 years in the health care domain upon completion of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology (IIEST).

Fundamental concepts of machine learning, deep learning and their applications in NLP in the direction of social computing have strongly increased my penchant for pursuing Ph.D. program in this subfield of computer science.
