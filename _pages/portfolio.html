During my master’s study, I worked on a project in <a href='https://www.i17.in.tum.de/en/team/prof-dr-krcmar-helmut/'>Prof. Krcmar's group</a> 
at the Technical University of Munich about analyzing developers’ reactions towards any change in application programming 
interfaces (APIs). This project aimed to bridge the gap between API providers and consumers to benefit both of them 
by generating a list of optimal criteria an API provider should follow to gain the popularity in developers’ circles. 
This project employed rule-based method and support vector machine (SVM) over data concerning conversations of developers.

Having Been a member of <a href='https://www.social.in.tum.de/en/group/'>PD Dr. Georg Groh's Social Computing group</a> 
at the Technical University of Munich, I performed an evaluation between unsupervised and pre-trained neural models, 
such as attention-based clustering model, Google's XLING and studied the extent to which they are beneficial in extracting 
meaningful topics out of textual data.

During my master thesis on multilingual aspect extraction, I realized that the word embedding model trained on large voluminous generic data was not able to 
understand the intricate contexts of the domain-specific corpus. After scouting through previous works and published 
literature I discovered that orthogonal Procrustes and canonical correlation analysis can align generic word embedding space 
with domain-specific, so that the lack of context can no longer be an obstacle. Amalgamation of mathematical foundation with 
NLP in the context of social computing made me think about other methods or concept that could be utilized to make 
deep learning-based models more effective and efficient in understanding optimized societal contexts and relations. 
Furthermore, through my thesis, I realized that there is no unique evaluation metric to measure the extent to which 
representative words describing a topic are coherent. I even noticed that depending on the evaluation metric, analysis and 
results are changed. This problem persists from the perspective of topic modeling. Therefore, I want to utilize my 
analytical expertise and research experience in NLP to alleviate such critical difficulties as well as explore novel 
approaches to generate a robust and fruitful solution in the direction of helping the human society.
